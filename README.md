# V:Multiplayer
..

The idea came in a small group to create a similar mod to 'SAMP' or at the time 'IVMP'. GTA V was on the horizon to be realised soon, so me and a small team set about creating our own multiplayer experience for GTA IV, hoping that we could later move it onto GTA V without too much effort.



This utilises various programming methods to achieve the goal of complete player and vehicle synchronisation using the Raknet library. This project was closed due to pressure from other mods/Take Two.
